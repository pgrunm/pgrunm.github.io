Hello, my name is Pascal. I'm working as a system engineer in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony and I'm 26 years old. I'm currently studying Business Informatics in my 6th semester so I'm almost done.

I'm reading a lot about of DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering and also my newest point of interest IT architecture. The stuff I read about in books or the internet I'm usually applying in private projets or at work. Some things you probably may can read sooner or later here in a blog post.

## Skills

- Windows Server and Linux systems engineering.
- Coding with Python3, Golang, Powershell, Bash and some Java or C.
- Knowledge with continuous integration and continuous deployment (i. e. with Jenkins and Ansible or Powershell DSC).
- Monitoring systems and services with Icinga 2 or Prometheus.
- Docker and K8s.
- Amazon Web Services knowledge (i. e. ELB, EC2 or AWS Lambda).
- I'm also TÃœV certified IT Architecture and Technology Professional.

## Projects

- I'm running a Raspberry Pi 4 at home which is completely managed with Ansible. Of course I can still login by SSH but I prefer using Ansible :-).
- I created an own telegram bot with Python 3. I dockerized the bot later, as you can see in my Github repo.
- For my university studies I created a simple dummy REST API to evaluate the scaling abilitys of different AWS technologys. I am going to write a blog post about this one.
- The latest one is this blog of course, hosted by Github pages and created with Hugo.
