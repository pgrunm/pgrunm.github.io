This HDD has a size of 3 TiB and is supposed to hold big files like videos, images and some games that are neigher read nor write intensive. Unfortunately I moved from my previous HDD with a Master Boot Record (MBR) and kept using the MBR.
This turned out to be a problem since MBR doesn&amp;rsquo;t support partitions larger than 2 TiB so I could not use all of my 3 TiB drive.</description></item></channel></rss>
