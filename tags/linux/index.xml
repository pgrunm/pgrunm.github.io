This HDD has a size of 3 TiB and is supposed to hold big files like videos, images and some games that are neigher read nor write intensive. Unfortunately I moved from my previous HDD with a Master Boot Record (MBR) and kept using the MBR.
This turned out to be a problem since MBR doesn&amp;rsquo;t support partitions larger than 2 TiB so I could not use all of my 3 TiB drive.</description></item><item><title>Setting up the new Raspberry Pi 4 with Ansible</title><link>https://pgrunm.github.io/posts/raspi4_setup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 18:45:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://pgrunm.github.io/posts/raspi4_setup/</guid><description>Since June 2019 the new Raspberry Pi 4 is available to buy. It features much more memory (up to 4 GiB), a Gigabit Ethernet port and two USB 3 ports. So there is a lot of power to compute with, but before we can start playing with it, we have to set it up.
One more thing to say: I don&amp;rsquo;t want to manage my Pi by CLI but with Ansible.</description></item></channel></rss>
