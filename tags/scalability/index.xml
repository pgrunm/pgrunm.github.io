I decided to develop some kind of dummy REST api application where I could try different architectures. The reason for me to try this out was to see how the performance changes over time if you increase the load.
I decided to use Go for this project, because it was designed for scalable cloud architectures and if you compile your code you just get a single binary file which you just have to upload to your machine and execute.</description></item></channel></rss>
